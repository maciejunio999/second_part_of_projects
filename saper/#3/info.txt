Purpose:

This Python code implements a graphical Minesweeper game using the Tkinter library. It creates a game window with a grid of buttons, each representing a cell on the game board. Clicking a button reveals the corresponding cell. If the cell contains a bomb, the game is over and the window is closed. If the cell does not contain a bomb, the button is updated to display the number of bombs adjacent to the cell.

Classes:

    Board: Represents a Minesweeper board.
      Attributes:
        - dim_size: The dimensions of the board (number of rows and columns).
        - num_bombs: The number of bombs on the board.
        - board: A 2D list representing the board cells.
        - dug: A set of (row, col) tuples representing the cells that have been dug.
      Methods:
        - make_new_board(): Generates a new board with random bomb placements.
        - assign_values_to_board(): Assigns values to the board based on bomb placements.
        - get_num_neighboring_bombs(row, col): Returns the number of bombs adjacent to the cell at (row, col).
        - dig(row, col): Attempts to dig at the cell at (row, col) and updates the board accordingly.

Functions:

    main(buttons, board, bb): Creates a window to play the game.
      Parameters:
        - buttons: A dictionary mapping button IDs to button objects.
        - board: A 2D list representing the board of the game.
        - bb: The instance of the Board class.
      Returns: The frame containing the game board.

Changes:

  The dim_size and num_bombs parameters for the Board constructor are now assigned values explicitly (instead of using default values).
  The not_clicked and active variables are now initialized to "black" and "red", respectively (instead of assigning them using separate statements).
  The default_color variable is now initialized to "white" (instead of assigning it using a separate statement).
  The main() function now takes a `list_of_board` parameter instead of directly accessing the `board` attribute of the `board_object`.
  The `click()` function now takes the `clicked_button` parameter as an additional argument.

Additional Notes:

The game uses the Tkinter library for graphical user interface (GUI) development.
The game uses random numbers to generate the placement of bombs.
The game does not support undo or multiple game modes.
