Purpose:

This Python code implements a graphical Minesweeper game using the Tkinter library. It consists of a menu function that creates a menu window and a main function that creates a game window and plays the game.

Classes:

    Board:
        Represents a Minesweeper board.
        Attributes:
            dim_size: The dimensions of the board (number of rows and columns).
            num_bombs: The number of bombs on the board.
            board: A 2D list representing the board cells.
            dug: A set of (row, col) tuples representing the cells that have been dug.
        Methods:
            make_new_board(): Generates a new board with random bomb placements.
            assign_values_to_board(): Assigns values to the board based on bomb placements.
            get_num_neighboring_bombs(row, col): Returns the number of bombs adjacent to the cell at (row, col).
            dig(row, col, roo): Attempts to dig at the cell at (row, col) and updates the board accordingly.

Functions:

    main(buttons, b, bb): Creates a window to play the game.
        Parameters:
            buttons: A dictionary of buttons on the game board.
            b: The board of the game.
            bb: The instance of the Board class.
        Returns: The frame containing the game board.
    menu(): Creates a menu window to select the size of the board and the number of bombs.
        Returns: None.

Variables:

    not_clicked: The default color for unclicked cells.
    active: The color for cells that have been flagged as bombs.
    default_color: The color for cells that have been dug and do not contain bombs.

Main Program:

The main program creates a menu window using the menu() function and then starts the game using the main() function.

User Interface:

The game window displays a grid of buttons, each representing a cell on the game board. Clicking a button flags the corresponding cell as revealed. If the cell contains a bomb, the game is over. If the cell does not contain a bomb, the button is updated to display the number of bombs adjacent to the cell.

Additional Notes:

    The game uses the Tkinter library for graphical user interface (GUI) development.
    The game uses random numbers to generate the placement of bombs.
    The game does not support undo or multiple game modes.
