Game Overview

This code implements a classic two-player Pong game using the Turtle graphics library and the Tkinter GUI framework. The game features two paddles controlled by players, a ball that bounces between the paddles and the walls, and a scorekeeping system. The goal of the game is to be the first player to reach a specified maximum score.

Key Features

    Simple two-player gameplay
    Animated ball movement with realistic bounces
    Interactive paddle movement responsive to keyboard input
    Scorekeeping system with game termination at maximum score

Gameplay Overview

    Starting the Game:
        Start the Tkinter window and menu interface.
        Select the desired maximum score from the provided options (2-9).
        Press the 'Start' button to initiate the game.

    Paddle Control:
        Player 1 controls the left paddle using the 'w' and 's' keys.
        Player 2 controls the right paddle using the 'Up' and 'Down' keys.

    Ball Movement and Collisions:
        The ball starts at the center of the screen and moves randomly in both x and y directions.
        The ball bounces off the walls (top, bottom, and sides) with alternating direction reversals.
        The ball bounces off the paddles with random velocity changes to enhance gameplay.

    Scorekeeping:
        Each time the ball crosses the opponent's goal line, the corresponding player's score increases by 1.
        The game ends when either player reaches the maximum score.

Technical Implementation

    Importing Libraries:
        Turtle: Provides graphics and animation capabilities for drawing the game elements.
        Random: Generates random values for ball velocity initialization and deflections.
        Tkinter: Constructs the GUI window and menu interface.

    Game Function:
        ping_pong(max_score): The core game logic function.
        Initializes game elements (paddles, ball, score counter).
        Handles game loop: updates ball position, velocity, and collisions.
        Applies paddle movement based on keyboard input.
        Detects and handles ball-paddle collisions with random velocity changes.
        Updates score counter and terminates the game when either player reaches the maximum score.

    Tkinter GUI:
        Creates a Tkinter window and sets its title and dimensions.
        Organizes the menu and game elements using three frames (upper, middle, and bottom).
        Displays instructions and a score display label in the upper frame.
        Allows the user to select the maximum score from a menu.
        Starts the game when the 'Start' button is pressed.
        Displays the current scores of both players in the bottom frame.

    Main Loop:
        Starts the Tkinter main loop to handle user interaction and display the GUI.
        Keeps the window open and updates the game elements until the game ends.
