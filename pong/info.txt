ping pong game
like bad in the days people used to play this game in arcade i made one myself
the concept is pretty easy two people paly ping pong, they use arrows or 'wsad' (keys) to move paddles and the ball moves itself
before we start a game we can chose how many points does a person need to be called winner, afters we click play new window appares and the game starts
ball bounces off paddles and top, bottom edges, if playes paddle misses ball his opponent gains a point

in order for this game to work and also beeing able to chose how many points we need to win i mage diferent function, called 'ping_pong', it gets called when we click 'Start'

start window was made using tkinter and includes some labels and choosing manu
this window is closed in mainloop, because there is no reason to close it after game ends, this way when players finish game they can start next one

whole ping_pong function takes care of gameplay, also we make turtle window there, why turtle? i use this library to draw all objects (ball, paddles)
when we call this function it makes wndow and places all objects within it

to make paddlez move we had to make diferent functions, because we want them to move on certain event in certian direction,
thats what for all paddle_a_up, paddle_b_down etc functions are for

we make call move by udating her coordinates thats why we set dy and dx (line 46-47), it all changes in while loop a bit further in code

in while loop i made ball move a bit more random, so it maybe be a bit more interesting, so ball can move in slightly diferent direction, with a bit different speed
